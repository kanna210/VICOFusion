#### Description:
For my final project, I redesigned and reformed the website for a local restaurant called Fusion, which is located near the Ohio University campus in Athens, Ohio. Fusion is a small restaurant that offers a variety of flavorful dishes inspired by Asian and international cuisine. From my personal experience and from word of mouth, the food at Fusion is very delicious and well prepared. However, despite the high quality of the food, I noticed that many people in the local community, including students, are either unaware of the restaurant or have not felt motivated to try it. This gap between the quality of the food and the restaurant’s visibility became the main inspiration for my project.

One of the key reasons I identified for this lack of awareness is Fusion’s limited online presence. While the restaurant appears to be connected to a food delivery service called Toast, its own official website provides only minimal information. At the time I reviewed it, the homepage included basic details such as the restaurant’s location and phone number, but very little else. There was no strong visual appeal, no clear presentation of the menu, and no storytelling that communicated what makes Fusion unique. In today’s digital environment, especially for small local businesses, a website often serves as the first impression. When that impression is weak or incomplete, potential customers may lose interest before ever visiting the restaurant in person.

I strongly believe that having an appealing, informative, and well-structured website is one of the most effective forms of advertising for a restaurant, particularly one located near a university campus. College students frequently search online for food options, whether they are new to the area or simply looking for something different to try. If a restaurant’s website does not capture attention or provide enough information, students are more likely to choose a more familiar or better-presented option. This is unfortunate in the case of Fusion, because the quality of its food deserves far more recognition.

The goal of my project was to redesign Fusion’s website so that it better represents the restaurant’s strengths and encourages more people to try it. I wanted the website to feel welcoming, modern, and visually engaging. By improving the layout, adding high-quality images, and organizing information clearly, I aimed to make the website more appealing and easier to navigate. I also focused on expanding the content so visitors could learn more about the restaurant’s menu, atmosphere, and identity, rather than seeing only basic contact details.

Another important motivation behind this project relates to the diverse student population at Ohio University. The university has many international students, including students from Southeast Asia and East Asia. For many international students, food plays an important role in emotional well-being and cultural connection. Being far from home can often lead to homesickness, and access to familiar or culturally similar food can provide comfort and a sense of belonging. Fusion offers dishes that reflect flavors from these regions, making it a valuable resource for international students seeking food that reminds them of home.

By redesigning Fusion’s website, I wanted to highlight this aspect more clearly and help the restaurant connect with international students who might benefit from its offerings. A stronger website can communicate that Fusion is not just another local restaurant, but a place where students from different cultural backgrounds can find familiar tastes and feel more at home. At the same time, it can introduce domestic students to new cuisines and encourage cultural exploration through food.

Overall, this project allowed me to combine technical web development skills with real-world problem solving. Rather than creating a website for an imaginary business, I worked with an existing local restaurant that has genuine potential to grow its audience. Through this redesign, I aimed to demonstrate how thoughtful web design can support small businesses, improve visibility, and strengthen connections within a community. I believe that with a more appealing and informative website, Fusion can attract more customers, gain the recognition it deserves, and continue serving delicious food to both local residents and the diverse student population at Ohio University.
